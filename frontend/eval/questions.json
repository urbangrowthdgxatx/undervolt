      "golden_answer": "**3-4x more solar per capita in western Austin** than eastern neighborhoods. Of Austin's 26,075 total installations, the concentration mirrors the income map almost exactly (0.78 correlation). Western ZIPs like 78746, 78703, and 78731 have the homeownership rates and upfront capital that solar requires. Eastern Austin's lower adoption reflects income constraints, not sun exposure \u2014 both sides get the same sunshine."

      "golden_answer": "**Closing the 5:1 backup power gap and 3-4x solar gap** would require massive investment in eastern Austin. Equal access means matching District 10's 2,151 generators in District 1's 175 \u2014 a 12x increase. Austin Energy's $735M ESRP and the $15M federal EV grant are steps, but private infrastructure would need to overcome the 0.78 wealth correlation that currently determines who has resilience."

As median home values hit ~$730K (up sharply from a decade ago), new construction in 78702 increasingly includes solar and modern electrical systems. But 78702's gains come through displacement economics \u2014 the infrastructure gap closes as the neighborhood's demographics shift, not because original residents benefit."
